GLES Triangle
=============

This is a simple OpenGL ES demo for the Raspberry Pi. It is based on the
code from chapter 2 of [OpenGL ES 2.0 Programming
Guide](http://opengles-book.com/). I have added a rotation matrix to the
vertex shader to rotate the triangle and a varying input to the fragment
shader to color each vertex differently.
