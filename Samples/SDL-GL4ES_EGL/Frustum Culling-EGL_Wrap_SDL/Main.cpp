// This tutorial demonstrates how to tell if an object is inside of your frustum or not.
// What is a frustum?  A frustum is the camera's view.  If something does NOT appear
// on the screen, then it is not inside of the frustum.  Think of it as a skewed box.
// It is skewed because the farther away, the more you can see.  It has 6 sides.
// There is the right, left, top, bottom, near and far.  Anything rendered outside
// of these planes, is not shown.  You need to know how to test this because it speeds
// up your programs, especially when there are a lot of objects, and/or a large world.
// You don't want to send you whole world down the 3D pipeline, that would kill your
// frame rate, so you want to test to see if the object would even NEED to be drawn
// before you send it to be rendered.  Certainly this is useless if you have very few objects,
// depending on their size of course.
//
// CONTROLS:
//      MOUSE MOVEMENT - Looks around
//      C, SPACE BAR, Mouse LEFT CLICK- Turns culling ON/OFF
//      +/- - Increase and decreases the amount of spheres
//      ESCAPE - quits

// You can tell how many spheres are being rendered out of how 
// many possible in the windows title bar.  You will notice the huge difference
// from 1000 possible spheres when frustum culling is turned off.  It barely moves.

#define MAX_SPHERES     1000                            // This holds the maximum amount of spheres.  (use + and - to change amount)

// * QUICK NOTES * 
//
// This is the largest tutorial we have created so far.  Not a lot of concept,
// but a lot of code.  The only code you need to look at is in RenderScene()
// and Frustum.cpp.  That is the good stuff :).  The rest of it is just to 
// make it a little more interesting.  I toiled over whether I should just have
// a bunch of spheres going back and forth on the screen, but I eventually decided
// it would be better if there was some camera movement so it didn't look fixed.
// You can use the mouse to move the camera around, as well as left click to turn
// culling on and off.  You can also add and subtract the spheres with '+'/'-'.
// Like Usual, Escape quits.  I took the Camera code from the Camera3 tutorial.
// This tutorial was based off the quadric tutorial.
//
// Let's go over a brief overview of the things we learned here:
//
// 1) First we need to abstract the frustum from OpenGL.  To do that we need the
//    projection and modelview matrix.  To get the projection matrix we use:
//
//          glGetFloatv( GL_PROJECTION_MATRIX, /* An Array of 16 floats */ );
//    Then, to get the modelview matrix we use:
//
//          glGetFloatv( GL_MODELVIEW_MATRIX, /* An Array of 16 floats */ );
//    
//    These 2 functions gives us an array of 16 floats (The matrix).
//
// 2) Next, we need to combine these 2 matrices.  We do that by matrix multiplication.
//
// 3) Now that we have the 2 matrixes combined, we can abstract the sides of the frustum.
//    This will give us the normal and the distance from the plane to the origin (ABC and D).
//
// 4) After abstracting a side, we want to normalize the plane data.  (A B C and D).
//
// 5) Now we have our frustum, and we can check points against it using the plane equation.
//    Once again, the plane equation (A*x + B*y + C*z + D = 0) says that if, point (X,Y,Z)
//    times the normal of the plane (A,B,C), plus the distance of the plane from origin,
//    will equal 0 if the point (X, Y, Z) lies on that plane.  If it is behind the plane
//    it will be a negative distance, if it's in front of the plane (the way the normal is facing)
//    it will be a positive number.
//
//
// If you need more help on the plane equation and why this works, download our
// Ray Plane Intersection Tutorial at www.GameTutorials.com.
//
// That's pretty much it with frustums.  There is a lot more we could talk about, but
// I don't want to complicate this tutorial more than I already have.
//
// I want to thank Mark Morley for his tutorial on Frustum.  Most of everything I got
// here comes from his teaching.  If you want more in-depth, visit his tutorial at:
