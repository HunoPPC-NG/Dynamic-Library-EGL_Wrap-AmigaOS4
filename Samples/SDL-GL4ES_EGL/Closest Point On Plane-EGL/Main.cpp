// This tutorial demonstrates how to find the closest point on a line segment, to a
// given point out in space.  You would use this algorithm for collision detection.
// In the Sphere Polygon Collision tutorial you can see how this is implemented.
// When running this program, you will see a green sphere that represents the point,
// along with a line segment and another blue sphere to represent the closest point
// on the line to the given point.  You are able to move the sphere and camera around
// with the following keys:
//
// LEFT ARROW - Moves the sphere left along it's current plane
// RIGHT ARROW - Moves the sphere right along it's current plane
// UP ARROW - Moves the sphere up along it's current plane
// DOWN ARROW - Moves the sphere down along it's current plane
// F3 - Moves the sphere towards the front of the line's plane
// F4 - Moves the sphere towards the back of the liness plane
// 
// F1 - Rotates the camera left
// F2 - Rotates the camera right
// ESC - Quits the program
//
// It is assumed that by reading this tutorial you understand the last few tutorials on
// normals and the dot product.  This was written in preparation for the Sphere Polygon
// Collision tutorial.  It is also assumed that you have looked at the quadric tutorial.
// This is because we use quadric spheres to simplify the tutorial and cut down code.
//
//

// This is the array of 2 vertices that will hold our line segment coordinates      
CVector3 g_vLine[2];

// This is the center of our sphere.  We are able to move it with the arrow keys.
CVector3 g_vPosition;

// This is the current rotation of our camera (F1 and F2 keys)
float g_rotateY = 0;

// * QUICK NOTES * 
//
// This tutorial is intended to be a preparation to the Sphere Polygon Collision tutorial.
// This is because we need to use this technique when doing our sphere polygon collision.
// 
// Our rendering function works like this:  First, we draw the line, then we draw the
// sphere representing the point, then we calculate the closest point on the line,
// then finally draw the closest point as a small sphere.  You can move the sphere
// around by using the appropriate keys.  You will see the sphere on the line
// move along, continually updated the closest point, depending on the position of the sphere.
//
// Here is a snippet from 3DMath.h that briefly explains how the math works:
// 
// The dot product is the key function that makes all this magic work.  Basically,
// if we get a vector between an end point of the line segment and the point, plus
// a normalized directional vector of that end point to the other end point, we can
// use the dot product to project the first vector onto the directional vector.  This
// gives us a distance from the new project vector to the end point.  If that distance
// is 0, the 2 vectors were perpendicular and the projected vector is directory on top
// of the end point, which would make the distance 0.  If the distance is negative, the
// point is on the outside of the line segment and closest to that end point.  If the
// distance is positive, we know that the point is on the other side of the end point.
// If we find the distance of the line segment, we can then check to see if the point
// is closest to a point on the line, or it is past the other end point, which makes that
// other end point the closest point to our given point.  To check the closest point
// is inside the line and not an end point, we just make sure that the original dot product
// result is less than the distance of the line segment. This distance can be calculated 
// using the normal distance formula you use in algebra.  
// 
// So to sum it all up... if the distance "t" is less than 0, our first end point is the
// closest point on the line, where if the distance "t" is greater than the distance of
// the line, distance "d", then it's the other end point.  If both of those fail, it must
// be on the line between the 2 end points.  To calculate where, we multiply our directional
// vector times the result of the dot product.  Then add that result to our original end point.
// That will give us the closest point on the line, between the 2 end points.
// 
// Now, move on to the next tutorial that talks about Sphere Polygon Collision.  This
// tutorial was created to help you better understand and prepare you for that collision tutorial.
