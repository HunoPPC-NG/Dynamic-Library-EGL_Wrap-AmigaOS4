// This tutorial shows you how to create a sky box.  A sky box is just a 3D box that
// has textures assigned to it which create an illusion that you are actually in
// a intricate world.  This is great because it it's fast to draw and looks cool in
// the background.  The textures used in this tutorial were created by Nick Coombe at
// http://www.planethalflife.com/crinity  | email: crinity@email.com.  I appreciate
// his artistic talent and for letting me use these for this tutorial and on our CD.
// How this works is, we create a box, and then assign the top, bottom, left, right,
// back and front textures to each side of the cube accordingly.  This will make it
// look like we are in a cool world, not an ugly cube :).  I struggled with adding
// camera support to this tutorial, but eventually gave in.  Though it might complicate
// an easy tutorial I figured there is no way to really get the effect without being
// able to look around.  You can use the mouse to look around, and the arrow keys
// to move within the sky box.  This tutorial was taken partly from the RotateCube
// tutorial.  I grabbed the camera and texture code from the TextureMap and Camera3 tuts.

// Below we create the new needed variables for this tutorial

#define SPEED    0.03f                                    // This is how fast our camera moves

// These defines correspond to an index within the g_Texture[] array.
// We will use these defines to bind the appropriate texture to the
// right side of the box.

#define BACK_ID        0                                    // The texture ID for the back side of the cube
#define FRONT_ID    1                                    // The texture ID for the front side of the cube
#define BOTTOM_ID    2                                    // The texture ID for the bottom side of the cube
#define TOP_ID        3                                    // The texture ID for the top side of the cube
#define LEFT_ID        4                                    // The texture ID for the left side of the cube
#define RIGHT_ID    5                                    // The texture ID for the right side of the cube

UINT g_Texture[MAX_TEXTURES] = {0};                        // This holds the texture info, referenced by an ID

          //     Position  View Vector   Up Vector

///////////////////////////////// CREATE SKY BOX \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*
/////
/////    This creates a box centered around X Y Z.  Instead of colors at
/////   each vertices there is texture maps for each side of the box to 
/////   create the illusion of the sky box.  You can set the width, height and length
/////   of the sky box to create different perspectives for different sky box textures.

    // This is the most important function of this tutorial.  This function
    // used to just create a silly colored cube in the RotateCube tutorial,
    // but now it creates something beautiful.  You'll notice we added
    // some more parameters to the function.  This way we can change the perspective
    // of the sky box.  It doesn't really look good if it's a perfect cube.  Some
    // textures look better at different ratios.  We assign the sky box textures
    // to each side of the box creating the illusion of a detailed 3D world.
    // You will notice I had to change the texture coordinates for every one
    // to be flipped correctly.  Also, depending on your culling, the vertex
    // order might need to be changed around.  I don't use culling in this tutorial
    // so it will work fine here, but be sure to remember this if you do.

    // to perform this task.  If we just minus half the width, height and length

// One IMPORTANT thing when using textures for sky maps is that

// We need to turn this to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE, otherwise it creates ugly seems
// in our sky box.  GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE does not repeat when bound to an object.
// To set this texture property we added these 2 lines to CreateTexture();

// glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
