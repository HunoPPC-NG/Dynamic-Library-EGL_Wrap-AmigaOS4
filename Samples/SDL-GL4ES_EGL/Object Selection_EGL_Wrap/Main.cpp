// *OBJECT SELECTING*

// This tutorial was created to show you how to select objects in 3D.
// Basically, what you are doing is taking an X and Y coordinate of the mouse
// and checking to see if any objects are in that region when projected to 2D from 3D.
// This can be very useful for level editors and menu/interface situations.
// The basic concept is, before you draw an object, you just assign an ID to it.

#define EARTH            101                                // This is the object ID for the EARTH
#define PLUTO            102                                // This is the object ID for PLUTO

        glLoadIdentity();                                // Reset our projection matrix

        // gluPickMatrix allows us to create a projection matrix that is around our
        // cursor.  This basically only allows rendering in the region that we specify.
        // If an object is rendered into that region, then it saves that objects ID for us (The magic).
        // The first 2 parameters are the X and Y position to start from, then the next 2
        // are the width and height of the region from the starting point.  The last parameter is
        // of course our view port coordinates.  You will notice we subtract "y" from the
        // BOTTOM view port coordinate.  We do this to flip the Y coordinates around.  The 0 y
        // coordinate starts from the bottom, which is opposite to window's coordinates.
        // We also give a 2 by 2 region to look for an object in.  This can be changed to preference.

        gluPickMatrix(x, viewportCoords[3] - y, 2, 2, viewportCoords);

        // Next, we just call our normal gluPerspective() function, exactly as we did on startup.

        // the number of objects that were found in our specified region (specified in gluPickMatrix())

        objectsFound = glRenderMode(GL_RENDER);            // Return to render mode and get the number of objects found

        glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);                    // Put our projection matrix back to normal.
    glPopMatrix();                                        // Stop effecting our projection matrix

    glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);                            // Go back to our normal model view matrix

    // PHEW!  That was some stuff confusing stuff.  Now we are out of the clear and should have
    // an ID of the object we clicked on.  objectsFound should be at least 1 if we found an object.

    if (objectsFound > 0)
    {        
        // If we found more than one object, we need to check the depth values
        // of all the objects found.  The object with the LEAST depth value is
        // the closest object that we clicked on.  Depending on what you are doing,
        // you might want ALL the objects that you clicked on (if some objects were
        // behind the closest one), but for this tutorial we just care about the one
        // in front.  So, how do we get the depth value?  Well, The selectionBuffer
        // holds it.  For every object there is 4 values.  The first value is
        // "the number of names in the name stack at the time of the event, followed 
        // by the minimum and maximum depth values of all vertices that hit since the 
        // previous event, then followed by the name stack contents, bottom name first." - MSDN
        // The only ones we care about are the minimum depth value (the second value) and
        // the object ID that was passed into glLoadName() (This is the fourth value).
        // So, [0 - 3] is the first object's data, [4 - 7] is the second object's data, etc...
        // Be carefull though, because if you are displaying 2D text in front, it will
        // always find that as the lowest object.  So make sure you disable text when
        // rendering the screen for the object test.  I use a flag for RenderScene().
        // So, lets get the object with the lowest depth!        

        // Set the lowest depth to the first object to start it off.
        // 1 is the first object's minimum Z value.
        // We use an unsigned int so we don't get a warning with selectBuffer below.
        unsigned int lowestDepth = selectBuffer[1];

        // Set the selected object to the first object to start it off.
        // 3 is the first object's object ID we passed into glLoadName().
        int selectedObject = selectBuffer[3];

        // Go through all of the objects found, but start at the second one
        for(int i = 1; i < objectsFound; i++)
        {
            // Check if the current objects depth is lower than the current lowest
            // Notice we times i by 4 (4 values for each object) and add 1 for the depth.
            if(selectBuffer[(i * 4) + 1] < lowestDepth)
            {
                // Set the current lowest depth
                lowestDepth = selectBuffer[(i * 4) + 1];

                // Set the current object ID
                selectedObject = selectBuffer[(i * 4) + 3];
            }
        }
        
        // Return the selected object
        return selectedObject;

// * QUICK NOTES * 
//
// This is probably our most complicated tutorial in OpenGL so far.  It gets into
// a lot of the tricky parts of matrices.  If you don't understand how a projection
// or model view matrix works, I would suggest looking up the nitty gritty details.
// It helps you really understand what OpenGL is doing.  Of course, you can always
// just shrug it off and say, "Well, I know it works and I have code to prove it!",
// but this will come to haunt you later when you want to do your own stuff.  You won't
// know what to do and how to effectively use OpenGL.  Eventually we will write some papers
// on this subject, but for now we want to focus mostly on code tutorials.
//
// So, how do you feel?  Do you have tons of ideas yet on what this could be used for?
// The first thing that comes to mind for me is interface stuff.  If you are going to
// have cool 3D menus, or a level editor you need to be able to identify what the heck
// the user is trying to click on.
// 
// You will notice that we took out all the full screen code.  That is because it's
// better to see in a window for the first time, also some people's machines handle the cursor
// differently (it won't show up in full screen).  You can mess around with full screen yourself.
// 
// Let's go over some of the steps in order to allow this magic to happen:
// 
// 1)  Once we find the X and Y position we want to check, we then setup our
//     array to hold the selection data.  To do this we call:
// 
//          glSelectBuffer(int SIZE, unsigned int ARRAY);        
// 
// 2) We will need our view port coordinates, so we call:
// 
//           glGetIntegerv(GL_VIEWPORT, int viewportArray[4]);    
//
// 3) Next, we need to be in projection mode so we can work with 2D in 3D space.
//    After we make this switch, we need to get out of RENDER mode and into SELECT mode:
//
//           glRenderMode(GL_SELECT);
// 
// 4) Now that we won't be rendering, but getting information, we need to tell OpenGL where
//    to look for the objects.  We do this by creating a region with:
//
//         gluPickMatrix(xPos, yPos, width, height, int viewport[4])
//
// 5) Next, we call gluPerspective() to create the correct projection matrix for that region.
//    We then need to select our mode view matrix in so we can draw the objects into the
//    selection buffer, NOT the frame buffer (because we are in GL_SELECT mode).
//    We call glInitNames() to clear the name stack (It does this anyway when going in GL_SELECT mode)
//
// 6) Before we render an object in, we need to tag an ID with that object so we know how to 
//    reference it later.  To do this, we call:
//
//           glLoadName(ID);  // The ID is our ID for the object to reference later
//    
//    Then we call glEnd(); to stop assigning polygons to that objectID.
//
// 7) Next, we want to go back to normal render mode.  Since we were just in GL_SELECT
//    mode, we get back the number of objects hit when we call:
//
//           numberOfObjectsHit = glRenderMode(GL_RENDER);
//
// 8) We close the current projection matrix by switching back to GL_PROJECTION,
//      then we go back into our model view matrix.
//
// 9) Finally, we should have the object ID's that we clicked stored in selectBuffer.
//    Each object has 4 slots of information [0 - 3] , [4 - 7], etc...
//    We only want the second and fourth because it holds the minimum depth and objectID.
//      Depending on how many objects we want to check simultaneously, we need to make our 
//    selection buffer bigger (the size should be (4 * objects) since the first 2/3 of the slots
//    holds depth information for each object).  Once again, be aware that if you render
//    2D texture or a fade/flash quad in front of you it will count that as an object clicked.
//    This is bad of course, so find a way (I used a flag) to NOT render those when you check.
//    If you don't call glLoadName() before rendering something, it's objectID will be 0.
//
// Remember, if you are using quadrics you should put a blank glBegin()/glEnd() statement
// between the glLoadName() and glEnd() or else some cards (like Voodoo) cards will staul.
// Also, I think I should point out something about object selection as we wrap this up.  You 
// might have seen functions like glPushName() and glPopName().  These can be used instead
// of glLoadName() and glEnd(), BUT they do not work on video cards like Voodoo and some others.
// It grinds the app to a horrible frame rate.  I have no idea why... just not supported well.
// If you DO use glPushName()/glPopName(), do NOT make the glPushName(0) call.
//
// This should be enough information for you to get started.  This is probably going to be one
// of those tutorials that you need to look over again and against until you understand what's 
// going on.  I love OpenGL though, because this seems so magical.  It does so much for you.
// I can just imagine doing this from scratch.  It's nice to have stuff like this hardware
// accelerated.
//
// Good Luck!
