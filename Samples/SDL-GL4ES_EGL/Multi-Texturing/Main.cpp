// This tutorial was taken from the original texture mapping tutorial.  Though not much code
// is added to this tutorial, it sure does something powerful, multitexturing.  With the
// constant upgrades from OpenGL, single pass multitexturing was thrown in along the way.
// The API's for multitexturing are what is called "extensions".  You either need the prototypes
// copied into your program, or you can carry around the glext.h file that holds all of
// the recent extensions created.  If you notice, there are tons of them out there.
// Extensions are things that are not a part of the normal opengl API, but have been added
// in as extras.  You have to have the latest version of OpenGL to allow multitexturing.
// I believe version 1.3 is the current version, at least for Microsoft windows.  To check
// if you have multitexturing enabled, try using the function:  glGetString(GL_EXTENSIONS)
// This returns a (char *) that holds all the extensions that are available to you.
// 
// * What is multitexturing? *
//
// Multitexturing is having 2 or more layers of textures on top of each other.  This is used
// for caustic effects, light maps, shadows, along with a few other graphic techniques.  You can
// sometimes accomplish the same effects with normal multitexturing, but you need to perform
// more than one pass, which means you draw the geometry more than once.  For instance, you
// could draw your wall, then just a tiny bit in front of it, draw a light map on the same wall.
// One problem with this is that if you wanted to cast a light map over a small part of a terrain, you
// would have some trouble doing so.  
//
// This application gives 2 examples of multitexturing.  The first one is a simple light map,
// while the second one is a neat background with fog rolling over top of it.
// To use the extensions, we need to load the functions from the OpenGL DLL.  Let take a look
// at the code
//
//

    // Now comes the fun part.  We need to specify which texture goes to what ID.  The ID's
    // go up to 31, with 0 a valid ID.  That means you could define up to 32 textures, but
    // of course you card would have to handle that many.  We only use 2.  To assign a texture
    // to an ID, we just set our texture ID active with glActiveTexture(), then call glBindTexture()
    // with out texture index.  Then, whenever we use glMultiTexCoord2fARB(), we just give it the
    // texture ID, such as GL_TEXTURE0_ARB, and it knows that the texture coordinates are for
    // the texture that was found to that ID.

    // Set the first texture ID to be active, then bind our brick texture to this ID.
    // Also, before you bind your texture, you MUST call: glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
    glActiveTextureARB(GL_TEXTURE0_ARB);

    // geometry rendered after it.  The matrix will be nixed anyway.

// * QUICK NOTES * 
//
// That is it!  I bet you thought there was more to this didn't you?  Well, there
// is actually.  We just skimmed the surface.  You will want to be able to
// fade certain textures, and have the background picture be more bright,
// or vice versa.  You will want to use the EXT_texture_env_combine extension.
// More on this extension in a future tutorial.  This extension will also
// allow you to do bump mapping extremely fast.
//
// Let's review:
//
// 1) Before we do anything, we need to create some function pointers to hold the
// extensions that are read in.  In order to use these data types, we need to have
// the prototypes either copied in to our program, or just include glext.h.
// you can just stick this file into your include\GL\ directory, where all your other
// opengl include files are: /usr/include/GL/
//
// 2) We check whether our card has multitexturing supports multitexturing or not.
// For this we get the glGetString(GL_EXTENSIONS) ;
// in this string we check for GL_ARB_MULTI_TEXTURE
// If we find it in that string then , Multitexturing is supported .
// Otherwise it is not supported
//
// 3) When we are about to render, we need to to assign our texture to a multitexture ID.
// That way, we can pass in that ID to specify which texture we are giving texture coordinates too.
//
// glActiveTextureARB(GL_TEXTURE0_ARB);
// glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
// glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D,  g_Texture[0]);
//
// 4) Now, when we want to give texture coordinates for our texture, we simply pass in the
// texture ID we want and it's texture coordinates to glMultiTexCoord2fARB().
//
// glMultiTexCoord2fARB(GL_TEXTURE0_ARB, 0.0f, 1.0f);
// glMultiTexCoord2fARB(GL_TEXTURE1_ARB, 0.0f - wrap, 1.0f);
// glVertex3f(-1, 1, 0);
//
// That's it!  Let us know at GameTutorials.com if this tutorial helps you.  We would love to
// see what you come up with.
